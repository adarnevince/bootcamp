The Linux text editor (vim)

-We can also use this editor to just read a text file.

Modes of Operation in vi editor

Command Mode
-When vi starts up, it is in Command Mode.
-This mode is where vi interprets any characters we type as commands and thus does not display them in the window.
-This mode allows us to move through a file, and to delete, copy, or paste a piece of text.
-To enter Command Mode from any other mode, it requires pressing the [Esc] key.
-If we press [Esc] when we are already in Command Mode, then vi will beep or flash the screen.

Insert mode
-This mode enables you to insert text into the file.
-Everything thatâ€™s typed in this mode is interpreted as input and finally, it is put in the file.
-The vi always starts in command mode.
-To enter text, you must be in insert mode.
-To come in insert mode, you simply type i.
-To get out of insert mode, press the Esc key, which will put you back into command mode.

Last Line Mode (Escape Mode)
-Line Mode is invoked by typing a colon [:], while vi is in Command Mode.
-The cursor will jump to the last line of the screen and vi will wait for a command.
-This mode enables you to perform tasks such as saving files, executing commands.
